IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY MATRIX
================================================================================

For immediate classroom use, implement in this order:

WEEK 1 PRIORITY:
- AudioManager (universal need for feedback)
- GameStateManager (essential for complete games)
- Basic UIManager (scores, health display)

WEEK 3 PRIORITY:
- CameraController (improved game feel)
- SaveLoadManager (progress persistence)
- ParticleManager (visual polish)

WEEK 6 PRIORITY:
- Advanced input systems
- Scene transition systems
- Settings management

This modular approach ensures students can create functional prototypes in any genre
while learning fundamental game development concepts through hands-on experimentation.
